<h1>Brennan's Best Movies (a non comprhensive list from a non movie goer)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of near-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Road to El Dorado</h3>
<p>
  I've loved this film since I was a child. The plot is fantastic and inspiring,
  and the characters have such humor between them!<br />
  The OST is also one of my favorites; the music is written by Elton John, and
  it ties in well with the themes and imagery of the film!
</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>
  This movie is a real mind-fuck. The concept fascinates me, and the
  cinematography is top notch. <br />
  I'll always be questioning the ending of Inception! There are so many little
  things to analyze that hint at the truth...
</p>
<h3>Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story</h3>
<p>
  This is my most quoted movie by FAR. I'm a musician, and this movie hits close
  to the heart on so many levels! <br />
  I can still watch Walk Hard and laugh at every joke, even though I know them
  all!
